## FAQ

#### How does it work?

Ah, just opens 30 tabs. There is no function in my editor to close tabs, so good luck!

#### What did you use to make the project?

*Better Scratchâ„¢* (aka *Turbowarp* by [@GarboMuffin](https://github.com/GarboMuffin) (aka a cool guy ðŸ˜Ž) )

#### IT OPENS TOO MUCH TABS! HOW CAN I STOP IT!?

You... can't. Well, just close the tab or wait until the grind is done. After it's done, close all the tabs.
